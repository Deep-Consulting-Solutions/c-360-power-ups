# Deployment Guide - C-360 Timer Power-Up

## Environment-Based Configuration

This Power-Up now uses **environment-based configuration** to automatically use the correct N8N webhook URLs for staging and production environments.

---

## How It Works

The build process automatically generates `public/js/config.js` based on environment variables:

### Environment Variables

Set these in your deployment environment (Vercel dashboard):

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `ENVIRONMENT` | Deployment environment | `staging` or `production` |
| `N8N_API_KEY` | N8N API authentication key | Your actual API key |

### Generated URLs

The build script automatically constructs URLs based on `ENVIRONMENT`:

**For `ENVIRONMENT=staging`:**
```
Start Timer: https://c360-staging-flows.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/staging/start-timer
Stop Timer:  https://c360-staging-flows.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/staging/stop-timer
```

**For `ENVIRONMENT=production`:**
```
Start Timer: https://c360-staging-flows.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/production/start-timer
Stop Timer:  https://c360-staging-flows.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/production/stop-timer
```

---

## Local Development Setup

### 1. Create `.env` File

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Edit `.env`:
```env
ENVIRONMENT=staging
N8N_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
```

### 3. Build and Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will:
1. Generate `public/js/config.js` from environment variables
2. Start local server on `http://localhost:3000`

---

## Vercel Deployment

### Setting Up Environment Variables

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables**
3. Add the following variables:

#### For Staging Deployment:
```
ENVIRONMENT = staging
N8N_API_KEY = your-staging-api-key
```

#### For Production Deployment:
```
ENVIRONMENT = production
N8N_API_KEY = your-production-api-key
```

### Deploy to Vercel

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Or push to your connected Git repository (auto-deployment).

---

## Build Process

The build process (`build-config.js`) automatically runs:

1. **During local development:** `npm run dev`
2. **During deployment:** Vercel runs `node build-config.js`
3. **Manual build:** `npm run build`

### What Happens During Build:

1. Reads environment variables (`ENVIRONMENT`, `N8N_API_KEY`)
2. Constructs N8N webhook URLs based on environment
3. Generates `public/js/config.js` with injected values
4. File is gitignored and regenerated on each deployment

## File Structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build-config.js          # Build script (generates config.js)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                     # Local environment variables (gitignored)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.example             # Template for environment variables
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ js/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.js        # Generated file (gitignored)
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.template.js # Template backup
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json             # Contains build scripts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vercel.json             # Vercel deployment config
```

## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Never Commit Secrets

- `.env` is gitignored
- `public/js/config.js` is gitignored
- API keys are injected at build time

### üîÑ Config File Generation

The `public/js/config.js` file is **auto-generated**. Do not edit it manually.

To change categories or user mappings, edit `build-config.js` template section.

### üåç Multiple Environments

You can create separate Vercel projects for staging and production:

1. **c360-timer-staging** ‚Üí Set `ENVIRONMENT=staging`
2. **c360-timer-production** ‚Üí Set `ENVIRONMENT=production`

---

## Troubleshooting

### Config file not updating?

Run the build script manually:
```bash
npm run build
```

### API calls failing?

1. Check Vercel environment variables are set
2. Verify N8N webhooks are active
3. Check browser console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console)
4. Verify API key is correct

### Local development not working?

1. Ensure `.env` file exists in project root
2. Run `npm run build` to generate config
3. Check that `public/js/config.js` was created

---

## Testing the Configuration

After deployment, test by:

1. Opening a Trello card
2. Clicking "Start Timer" button
3. Selecting a category
4. Clicking "Start Timer"
5. Check browser Network tab for POST request to correct N8N URL

Expected Request:
```
POST https://c360-staging-flows.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/staging/start-timer
Headers: X-API-Key: your-api-key
```

---

## Updating the N8N Base URL

If your N8N instance URL changes, edit `build-config.js` line 32:

```javascript
const N8N_BASE_URL = 'https://c360-staging-flows.app.n8n.cloud/webhook';
```
